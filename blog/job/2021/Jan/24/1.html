                <h3>Online Round</h3>
                <p> Amazon hosted the online round on Hackerearth platform. There were twenty MCQ’s based on computer science subjects like data structures, algorithms, Operating system, Database, Computer Networks, Theory of computation etc.</p>
                <h4>Two programming problems:</h4>
                <p>    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Given an unsorted array. Find the minimum number of elements which can be removed from it to make it a sorted array.</li>
                        <li>Given an array, find the maximum sum of non-consecutive elements. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-sum-such-that-no-two-elements-are-adjacent/">Link</a>
                        </li>
                    </ol>   
                </p>     
                <hr style="width: 50%;">
                <h3>F2F Round – 1</h3>    
                <p>Only one question was asked during this round. Given two linked lists and those linked lists represent two numbers and you have to multiply them and then return a new linked which contains the product.</p>
                <p>The problem was easy but I was nervous, so I made some mistakes. I thought that I will be rejected after this round but my code writing skills saved me. I practiced thousands of easy and medium problems on various online platforms and thus my hard-work saved me that day.</p>
                <p>Takeaway: Practice writing clean code. Even if the problem you are solving is an easy problem just try to write it’s code. It will make you faster and help you achieve cleanliness in your code. Also, by practicing problems you will be learn to give sensible names to your variables.</p>

                <h3>F2F Round – 2</h3>
                <p>
                    In this round three coding problems were asked from me.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/construct-a-special-tree-from-given-preorder-traversal/">Problem Link</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                Given a sorted matrix of 0’s and 1’s. By sorted I mean that matrix is sorted both row-wise and column-wise. Find the row with maximum number of 1’s. This was an easy version where the row with largest number of 1’s will be the last row.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                This is a harder version of second problem. In this the matrix is sorted row-wise but not column-wise. Try to solve this problem in O(n + m) time complexity, where n is number of rows and m is number of column in the matrix.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                        Again my clean code writing skills saved me. I had used reference variables(C++) in first problem, but my interviewer was not aware of reference variables. He knew about address operator and was thinking about reference variables the same way. So, I tried my best to convince him by giving various examples of passing a parameter to a function as reference using pointers and by reference variables.
                </p>

                <p>
                        Takeaway: You never know the expertise of your interviewer. For ex. in my case he may be expert in C but not in C++. So I would say that there is no need to learn all programming languages but instead try to master one.
                </p>
                <h3>F2F Round – 3</h3>
                <p>This interview round was my best round. As I entered the interview room, the interviewer started throwing operating system theoretical questions on me. Some of those questions were:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What is the difference between a thread and a process?</li>
                    <li>What is virtual memory?</li>
                    <li>What is a race condition?</li>
                    <li>What do you know about scheduling algorithms?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                        He also asked me to write code for two coding problems:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Given a matrix. Shift the matrix k-times clockwise. Shifting means that you have to shift elements by k steps in clockwise direction.</li>
                            <li>You are given an array A which contains ‘n‘ strings. Also a second array B will be given which will contain the lowercase characters which are important. Now you have to find a string from array A which will contain all the important characters and have the maximum count of important elements. If there are two or more answers for the problem, you have to print the string with lowest index. Desired complexity: O(n*max_length_of_strings_in_A)</li>
                        </ol>
                </p>
                <p>Takeaway: Only programming skills are not important during an interview for software engineering position, but also the theoretical knowledge of computer science subjects is essential.</p>
                <hr style="width: 50%;">
                <h3>Telephonic Round – 4</h3>
                <p>Questions asked in this interview were mostly behavioral. The interviewer was from Kindle team. So, the first question he asked from me was “Have you ever used kindle?”.</p>
                <p>Other questions asked from me were:
                    <ol>
                        <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tracking-current-maximum-element-in-a-stack/">Problem Link</a></li>
                        <li>When do we use threads and when do we use processes.</li>
                        <li>What are the problem with threads?</li>
                        <li>What is the most challenging project you ever did?</li>
                        <li>How you tested your project?</li>
                        <li>What is the mistake you made recently?</li>
                        <li>Why Amazon over your other internship companies?</li>
                        <li>I told him that I had used AWS, so he asked me what have I used in AWS?</li>
                        <li>Any other project that you did out of interest?</li>
                        <li>What technologies you’d learnt during that project(out of interest).</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>Takeaway: Behavioral questions are sometimes the most difficult to answer. So, collect all the behavioral questions asked from people in the interviews and think the solution for them in advance.</p>
                <p>Finally, I got the offer from Amazon. </p>
